# aiNet
aiNet(http://www.dca.fee.unicamp.br/~lboccato/IJNCR_vol1_p1_2010.pdf) implementation in Matlab. Some parts of the code (ie: extract.m) are not mine, but found in Internet.

Since I did't find any Matlab code of the specified algorithm, I'm post one here.


The main.m file contains especifications of parameters (including the function to maximize) and a call of the aiNet function with those definitions.

It passed some tests, but it not necessarily flawless.
